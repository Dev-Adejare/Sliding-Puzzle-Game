Certainly! Let's break down the JavaScript code step by step:

1. **Initial References**:
    - `moves`: Refers to an HTML element with the ID "moves."
    - `container`: Represents the first HTML element with the class "container."
    - `startButton`: Points to an HTML element with the ID "start-button."
    - `coverScreen`: Refers to the first HTML element with the class "cover-screen."
    - `result`: Represents an HTML element with the ID "result."
    - `currentElement`: A variable initialized as an empty string.
    - `movesCount`: A variable (not yet assigned a value).
    - `imagesArr`: An empty array.
    - `isTouchDevice`: A function that checks if the device supports touch events.

2. **Random Number for Image**:
    - The `randomNumber` function generates a random integer between 1 and 8 (inclusive).

3. **Get Coords Function**:
    - The `getCoords` function takes an HTML element as an argument.
    - It extracts the "data-position" attribute value from the element (expected format: "row_col").
    - The function splits this value into an array of two strings (row and column).
    - It converts these strings to integers and returns them as a pair of coordinates.

4. **Check Adjacent Function** (incomplete):
    - The `checkAdjacent` function starts with parameters `row` (presumably row coordinates) and `col` (presumably column coordinates).
    - However, the rest of the function is missing from the provided code snippet.

Overall, this JavaScript code seems to be related to handling game logic or interactions involving images (possibly a puzzle game). 
It initializes some variables, defines utility functions, and sets up event listeners.
